# eCommerceApp

This is an ecommerce app built using Spring-boot backend powered by MySql and Postgres databases interchangeably.
The app supports the following HTTP methods:
  - POST - For registration 
  - GET - Displaying products
We keep working on it with my friends to complete the app.

HOW TO RUN THE APP?
 - You will need the latest version of Android Studio.
 - A Spring-Boot compatible IDE (IntellJ) a good fit.
 - A MYSQL/POSTGRES Database for storing data.

Everyone is free to use this app in which ever way he/she can benefit from. Don't misuse the app though.
